Hi there! I am **Aravinda**.

I work at [Red Hat India Pvt. Ltd.](http://in.redhat.com/), Bangalore as **Senior Software Engineer**.

I like exploring OpenSource technologies and participating in different Open Source projects and Events. Most of my open Source projects are in [Github](https://github.com/aravindavk).

I started my website in 2008 and current version is 7th rewrote :) As of now my website is written using [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org) and [CouchDb](http://couchdb.apache.org/), and hosted in [Nodester](http://www.nodester.com/) and [Iris Couch](http://www.iriscouch.com/)  

Occasionally I travel/trek and take some photos. You can check those photos in [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/aravindavk) and [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/photos/112771262718323928488/albums).
