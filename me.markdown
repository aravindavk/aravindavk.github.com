Hi there! I am **Aravinda**.

I work at [Red Hat India Pvt. Ltd.](http://in.redhat.com/), Bangalore as **Senior Software Engineer**. 

I like exploring OpenSource technologies and participating in different Open Source projects and Events. Most of my open Source projects are in [Github](https://github.com/aravindavk).

I started my website in 2008 and current version is <strike>7th</strike>8th rewrote :) As of now my website is generated using a tool called [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

Occasionally I travel/trek and take some photos. You can check those photos in [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/aravindavk) and [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/photos/112771262718323928488/albums).
